RegTime,Plot's recovery time.,,
Treatment3,Plot's habitat type.,,
,,,
Traits measured:,,,
height,Plant height,,
fruit_abundance,Estimated abundance of fruits.,,
FruitWeight,"Weight of a single fruit. When more than one fruit was weighed together, it was noted in the comments column.",,

Traits_birds,,,
Obtained from AVONET.,,,
trait,Traits used :,Sex,Sex of the individual sampled: M = Male; F = Female; U = Unknown.
,,Beak.Width,Width of the beak at the anterior edge of the nostrils.
,,Hand.wing.Index,"100*DK/Lw, where DK is Kipp’s distance and Lw is wing length (i.e., Kipp’s distance corrected for wing size). Species average HWI differ from estimates in Sheard et al. (2020) because of much higher sampling of individuals in some species, as well as taxonomic effects in the BirdLife list."
,,Mass,Body mass given as species average (incorporating both male and female body mass).
,,,
